Description: cardio_train.csv is a cardiovascular dataset containing clinical and demographic information used to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This dataset includes features like age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, lifestyle habits, and BMI (calculated).

Key Features:

	•	age, gender, height, weight
  
	•	ap_hi (systolic BP), ap_lo (diastolic BP)
  
	•	cholesterol, gluc
  
	•	smoke, alco, active
  
	•	BMI (calculated), cardio (target)
  
Project Highlights:

	•	Data preprocessing including BMI calculation.
  
	•	Train-test split with standard scaling for numeric features.
  
	•	Models implemented: SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
  
	•	Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
  
	•	Visualizations: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, feature importances, bar chart comparison of metrics.
  
	•	Interactive Gradio app for predicting CVD risk for new patients.
